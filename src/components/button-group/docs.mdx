## Overview
ButtonGroup can be used to group related options. To emphasize groups of related toggle buttons, a group should share a common container.
  <Canvas of={ButtonGroupStories.Default} />

## Props
  <Controls of={ButtonGroupStories.Default} />

## Variants

### Sizes

  <Canvas of={ButtonGroupStories.Sizes} />

### Disabled
Set disable button for something that isn’t usable. Use a tooltip on hover in order to indicate the reason of the disabled action.
  <Canvas of={ButtonGroupStories.Disabled} />


## Tips
➡️ Group together calls to action that are related to each other.  
➡️ Use when all the actions in the group take place immediately in one click. If one or more actions does not immediately happen in one click, either use a different component, or remove those actions from the group.  
➡️ Only should be used in groups of up to six buttons if the buttons contain an icon with no text.  
➡️ The main action of a button group will be in selected mode.  
➡️ Keep the content short and actionable. For longer actions, use the Dropdown component.  
➡️ Button group is used to diplay the same content in diffrent view, if you need to present diffrent content, use Tabs.
