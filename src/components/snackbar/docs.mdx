## Tips

➡️ Use toast notifications immediately after a specific event such as a user action that does not relate to an object on the page. Toast used as a feedback loop to a user’s action.  
➡️ Toasts should appear one at a time, and only disappear when no longer required.  
➡️ Always be clear, concise and, where possible, give follow up actions to allow the user to become more informed or resolve the issue.  
➡️ Always provide an action button or option to undo.  
➡️ Toast should overlay permanent UI elements without blocking important actions.
