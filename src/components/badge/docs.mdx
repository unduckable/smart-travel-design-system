## Overview
Badges are compact elements that represent an input, attribute, or action. They may display text, icons, or both.

  <Canvas of={BadgeStories.Default} />


## Props

### Shapes

## Tips 
➡️ Badges represent a complex piece of information in compact form, such as an entity (person, place, or thing) or status. They enable user input and verify that input by converting text into badges.  
➡️ Use badges when content is mapped to multiple categories, and the user needs a way to differentiate between them.
