## Overview

Buttons allow users to trigger an action or event with a single click.
For example, you can use a button for allowing the functionality of submitting a form, opening a dialog, canceling an action,
or performing a delete operation.

## Props


<Controls of={ButtonStories.Default} />


## Variants

### Button kinds

There can be more than one button in a screen, but to create the hierarchy of actions we need to use button intents.
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Intents} />

### Sizes

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Sizes} />


### Disabled

Set disable button for something that isn’t usable. Use a tooltip on hover in order to indicate the reason of the disabled action.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Disabled} />

### Actives

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Active} />

## Tips 

➡️ Buttons may contain icon, on the left or the right side  
➡️ Replace text with a loader if action is submitted, but still processing  
➡️ Button width is set by it’s content, avoid changing it width  
➡️ Use only one primary button, and any remaining calls to action should be represented as lower emphasis buttons
